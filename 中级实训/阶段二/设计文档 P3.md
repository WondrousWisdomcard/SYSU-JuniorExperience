**郑有为 19335286**

Inception: clarify the details of the problem:

a. What will a jumper do if the location in front of it is empty, but the location two cells in front contains a flower or a rock?

回答：如果是 Rock，选择这一步不移动，而是改变方向（`turn()`）；如果是 Flower，则移除 Flower，然后跳到该位置。

b. What will a jumper do if the location two cells in front of the jumper is out of the grid?

回答：选择这一步不移动，而是改变方向（`turn()`）

c. What will a jumper do if it is facing an edge of the grid?

回答：选择这一步不移动，而是改变方向（`turn()`）

d. What will a jumper do if another actor (not a flower or a rock) is in the cell that is two cells in front of the jumper?

回答：选择这一步不移动，而是改变方向（`turn()`）

e. What will a jumper do if it encounters another jumper in its path?

回答：选择这一步不移动，而是改变方向（`turn()`）

f. Are there any other tests the jumper needs to make?

回答：无

\* You should answer the above questions **simply** in your design report.
