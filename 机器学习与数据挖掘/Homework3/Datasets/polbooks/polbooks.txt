Books about US politics
Compiled by Valdis Krebs

Nodes represent books about US politics sold by the online bookseller
Amazon.com.  Edges represent frequent co-purchasing of books by the same
buyers, as indicated by the "customers who bought this book also bought
these other books" feature on Amazon.

Nodes have been given values "l", "n", or "c" to indicate whether they are
"liberal", "neutral", or "conservative".  These alignments were assigned
separately by Mark Newman based on a reading of the descriptions and
reviews of the books posted on Amazon.
